## **90-Day System Design Mastery Plan**

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1–20)**

#### **Objective**: Build a strong conceptual understanding of core system design principles.

**1. Core Concepts**

-   **High-Level Design (HLD)**:

    -   Focuses on **architecture**, major components, and **data flow**.
    -   Emphasizes **scalability**, **availability**, and **reliability** strategies.
    -   **Example**: Designing a ride-sharing app's architecture using microservices.

-   **Low-Level Design (LLD)**:

    -   Deals with implementation details like APIs, algorithms, and schemas.
    -   Focuses on **maintainability** and **performance optimization**.
    -   **Example**: Crafting SQL queries for a user management module.

-   **Key Concepts**:
    -   **Scalability**: Handle increasing loads (vertical vs. horizontal scaling).
    -   **Reliability**: Keep the system operational during failures.
    -   **Availability**: Ensure uptime for users.
    -   **Maintainability**: Modular designs, clean code, and automation practices.

**2. Learn Essential Components**

-   **Load Balancers**: Prevent server overload using strategies like Round Robin.
-   **Caching**: Use tools like Redis to speed up read-heavy operations.
    -   **Example**: Cache frequently accessed product details on an e-commerce site.
-   **Data Structures for System Design**:
    -   Focus on **consistent hashing**, **LRU Cache**, and **priority queues**.

**3. Tools & Exercises**

-   Use **Excalidraw** or **Lucidchart** for system architecture diagrams.
-   Implement projects:
    -   **TinyURL**: URL shortening with a database.
    -   **Chat System**: Simulate a real-time messaging service using WebSockets.

-   **Notification Service**: Architect with event queues and push mechanisms.

**3. Projects**

-   Build a **real-time chat app** with WebSockets and deploy mock services.
-   Design and deploy a **scalable URL shortener** with Redis and database integration.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Design (Days 51–75)**

#### **Objective**: Solve complex problems and learn design trade-offs.

**1. Advanced Topics**

-   **Event Sourcing & CQRS**:
    -   Event Sourcing: Store all changes as events.
    -   CQRS: Separate read/write operations for better scalability.
    -   **Example**: Maintain a log of edits in collaborative documents.
-   **Fault Tolerance**:
    -   Use circuit breakers (e.g., Hystrix), replication, and failover mechanisms.

**2. System Design Problems**

-   **Design YouTube**:
    -   Focus on video storage, encoding, CDN, and recommendations.
-   **Design Uber**:
    -   Handle real-time location updates and dynamic pricing.
